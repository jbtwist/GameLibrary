# Game Library

This is a React Native template for building cross-platform mobile applications using Expo, React Native, and React Native Web. The template includes a setup for absolute paths, unit testing with Jest and ESLint for linting.

## Features

- **Expo**: Simplifies the development and deployment of React Native apps.
- **React Native Web**: Enables React Native components to be used in web applications.
- **Absolute Paths**: Uses `babel-plugin-module-resolver` to avoid relative paths.
- **Unit Testing**: Configured with Jest for testing components and logic.
- **ESLint**: Configured for linting JavaScript/TypeScript code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jbtwist/GameLibrary.git
    cd GameLibrary
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Expo development server:

    ```sh
    npx expo start
    ```

    This will generate a localhost server and a QR code to access the app via Expo Go (Android) or QR reader (Iphone)    

# Developing style

- Eslint 8.x already configured
- Use 2 spaces for tabbing
